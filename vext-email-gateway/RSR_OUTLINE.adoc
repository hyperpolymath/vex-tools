== Status

This directory is an active project inside the `vex-tools` monorepo.
The previous template boilerplate has been retired for this project.

== Source Of Truth

* Repository overview: link:../README.adoc[../README.adoc]
* Project readme: link:README.adoc[README.adoc]
* Project roadmap: link:ROADMAP.adoc[ROADMAP.adoc]
* Machine-readable state: use `./.machine_readable/` when present, otherwise `../.machine_readable/`.

== Working Rules

1. Use this directory's `justfile` and documented commands as authoritative.
2. Keep status language honest: mark unfinished features as "not wired up yet".
3. Keep ISA naming consistent in human docs: "ISA (formerly Vexometer)" on first mention.
4. Update roadmap and machine-readable state when scope or delivery status changes.
