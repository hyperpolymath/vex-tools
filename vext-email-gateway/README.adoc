Email bridge between the vext protocol and traditional email workflows.

== Status

*Prototype / in-progress.*  
Architecture and major data-flow concepts are present, but end-to-end production wiring is not complete yet.

== Intended Responsibilities

* Ingest email messages and map them into vext messages
* Publish vext messages to configured network backends
* Manage mailing-list style subscriptions for tagged feeds
* Deliver vext content back to email subscribers

== Current Gaps

* Identity persistence is not finalized
* Network client wiring is still prototype-level
* SMTP/IMAP operational loop is not fully implemented
* Test coverage and CI readiness are incomplete

See link:ROADMAP.adoc[ROADMAP.adoc] for staged completion targets.

== Repository Notes

* This component is intentionally not included in monorepo `test-all` until its compile/test baseline is stable.
* ABI/FFI reference material remains available in `ABI-FFI-README.md` and `src/abi/`.
