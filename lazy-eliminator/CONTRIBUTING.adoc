=== 4. Pull Request Process

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a branch: `git checkout -b improve-python-detection`
3. Make changes with SPDX headers
4. Run `just check` and `just test`
5. Commit with conventional commits:
+
[source]
----
feat: add support for Python walrus operator
fix: reduce false positives for empty blocks
docs: update README with new examples
----
6. Submit PR with clear description

=== 5. Pattern Contribution Guidelines

When adding new incompleteness patterns:

1. **Provide examples**: Show code that should be detected
2. **Test false positives**: Ensure legitimate code isn't flagged
3. **Severity justification**: Explain severity score assignment
4. **Multi-language**: Consider if pattern applies to other languages

Example PR:

[source]
----
feat: detect Python ... in type annotations

Adds detection for ellipsis (...) in type stubs:

    def foo() -> int: ...

Severity: 0.8 (PlaceholderText)
Applies to: Python only
False positive rate: <1% (tested on 1000 files)
