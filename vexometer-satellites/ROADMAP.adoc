= ISA Satellites Roadmap
:toc: left
:toclevels: 2

== Current Status

Ecosystem design and protocol contracts are documented. Most individual satellites remain planned rather than implemented.

== Near-Term Milestones

* [ ] Publish authoritative satellite registry status table (implemented/in-progress/planned)
* [ ] Freeze `vexometer-trace-v1` and `vexometer-efficacy-v1` schemas
* [ ] Add reference validation fixtures for trace and efficacy reports
* [ ] Document integration contract between ISA core and satellite outputs

== Implementation Sequence

=== Phase 1: First Production Satellite

* [ ] Drive `vex-lazy-eliminator` to production-ready integration quality
* [ ] Publish reproducible before/after efficacy pack
* [ ] Validate end-to-end compatibility with ISA metrics pipeline

=== Phase 2: High-Impact Satellites

* [ ] `vex-hallucination-guard`
* [ ] `vex-sycophancy-shield`
* [ ] `vex-scope-governor`

=== Phase 3: Ecosystem Maturity

* [ ] Cross-satellite compatibility matrix
* [ ] Versioned contract for satellite metadata
* [ ] Shared CI templates for satellite repositories
