# AI Assistant Instructions

## Repository Focus
- `ISA Satellite Template` is a component of the `vex-tools` monorepo.
- Treat this directory as RSR-aligned, but use real machine-readable sources instead of template placeholders.
- Prefer keeping generated artifacts out of source control unless explicitly required.

## Workflow
1. If `./.machine_readable/STATE.scm` exists, use it; otherwise use `../.machine_readable/STATE.scm`.
2. If `AGENTIC.scm` exists beside STATE, obey it for tool/process constraints.
3. When files are not wired yet, state that explicitly rather than implying full support.
4. Keep naming consistent: use ISA (formerly Vexometer) on first human-facing mention.

## Delivery Promises
- Mention whether machine-readable state changed.
- Keep this file synchronized with actual repository structure and commands.
