= Contractiles Template Set
:toc:
:sectnums:

This directory contains the generalized contractiles templates. Copy the `contractiles/` directory into a new repo to establish a consistent operational, validation, trust, recovery, and intent framework.

== Fill-In Instructions

1. Update the Mustfile to reflect your real invariants (paths, schema versions, ports).
2. Replace Trustfile.a2ml example values with your project-specific trust material.
3. Adjust Dustfile handlers to match your rollback and recovery tooling.
4. Update Intentfile to mirror the roadmap you want the system to evolve toward.

== Contents

* `must/Mustfile` - required invariants and validations.
* `trust/Trustfile.a2ml` - cryptographic verification steps.
* `dust/Dustfile` - rollback and recovery semantics.
* `lust/Intentfile` - future intent and roadmap direction.
