= ISA Satellite Template Roadmap

== Purpose

This repository is a reusable template for new ISA satellite projects.
Placeholder markers are intentional and are meant to be replaced by each generated satellite.

== Template Maintenance Milestones

=== v0.1.x

* [ ] Keep scaffold aligned with current RSR requirements
* [ ] Keep ABI/FFI template files aligned with current conventions
* [ ] Keep contractiles examples and docs current

=== v0.2.x

* [ ] Add generator validation checklist for new satellite repos
* [ ] Add CI starter workflow for satellite projects
* [ ] Add sample trace/efficacy artifacts to speed onboarding

== Definition of Done for Template Releases

* [ ] New satellite repo can be instantiated without broken placeholders in required files
* [ ] README/ROADMAP language is explicit about replacement steps
* [ ] Generated repos pass baseline lint/test scaffolding checks
