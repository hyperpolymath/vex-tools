Consolidated monorepo for all VEX-related tools: the ISA (Irritation Surface Analyser, formerly Vexometer), its satellite intervention system, and the Vext verifiable communications protocol.

== Naming Convention

* *Canonical product name*: *ISA* (Irritation Surface Analyser)
* *Legacy compatibility identifier*: `vexometer`
* The `vexometer` identifier remains in repository paths, package names, CLI commands, and protocol IDs (for example `vexometer-trace-v1`) to preserve compatibility.
* See link:NAMING.md[NAMING.md] for the authoritative naming policy used across this repository.

| Directory | Description

| `vexometer/`
| **ISA (formerly Vexometer)** -- Irritation surface analyser for AI assistants. Quantifies irritation across 10 dimensions with standardised, reproducible metrics.

| `vexometer-satellites/`
| **ISA Satellites (vexometer-satellites)** -- Umbrella documentation and coordination hub for the satellite intervention system.

| `satellite-template/`
| **Satellite Template** -- Scaffolding template for creating new ISA satellite projects.

| `lazy-eliminator/`
| **Lazy Eliminator** -- Completeness enforcement for LLM-generated code. Detects and eliminates lazy patterns.

| `vext/`
| **Vext** -- Verifiable, Extensible Communications Protocol with cryptographic proof of algorithmic neutrality.

| `vext-email-gateway/`
| **Vext Email Gateway** -- Email bridge for interoperability between Vext and traditional email (*prototype; end-to-end wiring in progress*).

== Component Origins

This monorepo was consolidated from six independent repositories:

* `hyperpolymath/vexometer` -> `vexometer/`
* `hyperpolymath/vexometer-satellites` -> `vexometer-satellites/`
* `hyperpolymath/vex-satellite-template` -> `satellite-template/`
* `hyperpolymath/vex-lazy-eliminator` -> `lazy-eliminator/`
* `hyperpolymath/vext` -> `vext/`
* `hyperpolymath/vext-email-gateway` -> `vext-email-gateway/`
