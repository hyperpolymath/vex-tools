- Matrix: @security:vext.dev
- Signal: Available upon request

### What to Include

When reporting vulnerabilities, please include:

1. **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
2. **Impact**: Potential security impact and attack scenarios
3. **Reproduction**: Step-by-step reproduction instructions
4. **Environment**: Version, OS, configuration details
5. **PoC**: Proof-of-concept code (if available)
6. **Suggestions**: Proposed fixes or mitigations (optional)

### Response Process

1. **Acknowledgment** (24-48 hours)
   - We'll confirm receipt of your report
   - Assign a tracking number
   - Provide initial assessment timeline

2. **Investigation** (1-7 days)
   - Verify and reproduce the vulnerability
   - Assess severity and impact
   - Develop and test fixes

4. **Disclosure** (After fix release)
   - Public security advisory
   - CVE assignment (if applicable)
   - Credit to reporter (if desired)

### Severity Classification

We use CVSS 3.1 for severity ratings:

| Severity | CVSS Score | Response Time | Fix Timeline |
| -------- | ---------- | ------------- | ------------ |
| Critical | 9.0-10.0   | 24 hours      | 7 days       |
| High     | 7.0-8.9    | 48 hours      | 14 days      |

## ✅ Security Best Practices

### For Deployers

1. **Keep Updated**: Always run the latest version
2. **Restrict Access**: Limit who can send notifications
3. **Monitor Logs**: Enable security event logging
4. **Use TLS**: Enable TLS for IRC connections when possible
5. **Firewall Rules**: Restrict network access appropriately
6. **Sandboxing**: Use systemd sandboxing in production
7. **Rate Limits**: Configure appropriate rate limits
8. **Least Privilege**: Run with minimal required permissions

### For Developers

1. **Review Changes**: All code changes undergo security review
2. **Test Thoroughly**: Include security test cases
3. **Validate Input**: Sanitize all external input
4. **Avoid Secrets**: Never commit credentials or keys
5. **Dependencies**: Keep dependencies minimal and updated
6. **Static Analysis**: Run security scanners before commits
7. **Secure Defaults**: Configuration defaults should be secure

## 🔐 Cryptographic Disclosure

vext does not implement custom cryptography. When encryption is needed:

- **TLS/SSL**: Uses Python's `ssl` module (OpenSSL)
- **Random Numbers**: Uses `secrets` module for CSPRNG
- **Hashing**: Uses `hashlib` for non-cryptographic hashing

## 📜 Compliance

vext follows these security standards:

- **RFC 9116**: `.well-known/security.txt` (security contact information)
- **CWE**: Common Weakness Enumeration awareness
- **OWASP Top 10**: Protection against common vulnerabilities
- **CVE**: CVE assignment for significant vulnerabilities
