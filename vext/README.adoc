== Overview

**Vext** is a cryptographically verifiable communications protocol that provides mathematical proof of algorithmic neutrality. It combines proven protocols (NNTP, Email, Gemini) with modern cryptographic guarantees (Merkle trees, digital signatures, formal verification).

**Key Innovation:** The **a2ml** (Anti-Algorithm Markup Language) verification layer, which requires Idris2's dependent types to provide compile-time proofs of feed integrity.

=== The Problem

Modern social media platforms:

* ❌ Use opaque algorithms to reorder, filter, and inject content
* ❌ Insert advertisements disguised as organic content
* ❌ Shadowban users without transparency
* ❌ Profile users for targeted manipulation
* ❌ Cannot prove they don't manipulate feeds

**Result:** Information asymmetry, manipulation, broken economics for creators.

=== The Solution

Vext provides **cryptographic proofs** that feeds are:

* ✅ **Chronological** (not algorithmically sorted)
* ✅ **Ad-free** (no injected advertisements)
* ✅ **Uncensored** (no hidden messages)
* ✅ **Verifiable** (users can check the math)

**Don't trust us. Verify the cryptography.**

=== a2ml: Anti-Algorithm Markup Language

**Why Idris2?**

a2ml requires *dependent types* to prove properties at compile-time:

* **Type-level proofs** that feeds are chronological
* **Totality checking** (proofs cannot loop infinitely)
* **Linear types** (resources consumed exactly once)
* **Formal verification** exceeding what ATS, Rust, or Coq can provide

**Example (Idris2):**
[source,idris]
----
-- Chronological feed proven at TYPE LEVEL
data ChronologicalFeed : List Message -> Type where
  Empty : ChronologicalFeed []
  Cons : (m1 : Message) -> (m2 : Message) ->
         {auto prf : timestamp m1 <= timestamp m2} ->
         ChronologicalFeed (m2 :: rest) ->
         ChronologicalFeed (m1 :: m2 :: rest)

-- IMPOSSIBLE to construct if feed isn't chronological!
----

This is impossible in Rust, Go, or even ATS.

=== Protocol Bridges

Vext connects to existing protocols:

[cols="2,3,2"]
|===
|Protocol |Use Case |Status

|*NNTP* |Newsgroups, power users |Core protocol
|*Email* |Universal access, mailing lists |Gateway implemented
|*SMS* |Mobile access (basic) |Planned
|*RCS* |Mobile access (rich) |Planned
|*Gemini* |Smol internet, privacy |Planned
|*Matrix* |Federation bridge |High priority
|*Web* |Universal fallback |PWA planned
|===

== Use Cases

=== For Journalists

* **Attribution guaranteed** (cryptographic signatures)
* **No censorship** (provably uncensored feeds)
* **Source protection** (E2E encryption for DMs)
* **Fair compensation** (direct support, no platform tax)

=== For Privacy Advocates

* **No profiling** (no algorithmic targeting possible)
* **No tracking** (DIDs instead of emails/phone numbers)
* **Open source** (reproducible builds)
* **Formal verification** (proven secure)

=== For Everyone

* **Chronological feeds** (like "the old internet")
* **No ads** (cryptographically proven)
* **No manipulation** (mathematically impossible)
* **Works everywhere** (email, SMS, web, native apps)

== Research

=== arXiv Paper (Planned)

**Title:** _Cryptographic Proofs of Algorithmic Neutrality in Federated Communication Systems_

**Categories:**
* cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) - Primary
* cs.NI (Networking and Internet Architecture)
* cs.CY (Computers and Society)

**Status:** Implementation in progress, paper draft planned for Q2 2025

See: link:docs/VEXT-ARXIV-PAPER-PLAN.md[arXiv Paper Plan]

=== NUJ Discussion Paper

**For:** National Union of Journalists Ethics Council

**Framing:** Labor and ethics issue, not just technology:
* Platform dependency hurts journalists
* AI pollution undermines attribution
* Broken economics (platform takes 30-50% cut)
* Censorship without accountability
