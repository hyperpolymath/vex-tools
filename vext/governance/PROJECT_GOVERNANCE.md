# Project Governance

**SPDX-License-Identifier: PMPL-1.0-or-later

## 🏛️ Overview

vext uses the **Tri-Perimeter Contribution Framework (TPCF)**, a graduated trust model that balances security, community openness, and sustainable project governance.

TPCF organizes contributors into three concentric perimeters based on trust, expertise, and responsibility.

## 🎯 Governance Philosophy

Our governance is designed to:

- **Foster Community**: Welcome contributors at all skill levels
- **Maintain Quality**: Ensure high standards through graduated responsibilities
- **Enable Security**: Protect critical infrastructure through access controls
- **Promote Transparency**: Make decisions openly and documentably
- **Support Sustainability**: Build long-term project health
- **Respect Autonomy**: Allow contributors to self-organize within guidelines

## 🔷 Three-Perimeter Model
