= Contractiles Policy Set
:toc:
:sectnums:

This directory contains the operational contractiles policies for this component.
It is derived from the template set but maintained as live project policy.

== Fill-In Instructions

1. Update the Mustfile to reflect your real invariants (paths, schema versions, ports).
2. Keep `trust/Trustfile.a2ml` current via `../../scripts/trust/rotate-trustfile.sh` and regenerate `.trust/trust-manifest.sha256`.
3. Adjust Dustfile handlers to match your rollback and recovery tooling.
4. Update Intentfile to mirror the roadmap you want the system to evolve toward.

== Contents

* `must/Mustfile` - required invariants and validations.
* `trust/Trustfile.a2ml` - cryptographic verification steps.
* `dust/Dustfile` - rollback and recovery semantics.
* `lust/Intentfile` - future intent and roadmap direction.
